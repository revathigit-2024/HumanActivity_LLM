These test questions cover a wide range of scenarios with varying:
- Activity levels (steps and calories)
- Heart rates
- Sleep durations
- Mood scores
- Number of days of data

Each set is designed to test the model's ability to:
1. Handle different data patterns
2. Consider multiple factors
3. Provide consistent predictions
4. Work across different modes (zero-shot, few-shot, etc.)
5. Maintain predictions within the valid range (1-5)

You can test these with different combinations of:
- Models (Fine-tuned, OpenAI, Gemini)
- Modes (zero-shot, few-shot, few-shot_cot, few-shot_cot-sc)
- Prediction types (fatigue, stress, readiness, sleep_quality)
